# Roquefort Coleslaw

*This is pretty much the only coleslaw that I have ever thoroughly enjoyed. Usually they are a puddle of liquid mess, or too sweet, or something. I never liked coleslaw until I visited Fallingwater.*

Serves 4 to 6

*The Roquefort, or blue, cheese adds the gourmet touch to this salad, an excellent accompaniment to fish or fowl.*

## Ingredients

- 4 cups finely chopped cabbage
- 1/3 cup chopped onion
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/4 cup Boiled Salad Dressing ([recipe here](https://github.com/bobtiki/Recipes/blob/master/Boiled_Salad_Dressing.md))
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
- Freshly ground pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup Roquefort, or blue, cheese

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, toss the cabbage and chopped onion
2. Blend the sour cream, salad dressing, salt, dry mustard, and pepper. Add the blue cheese.
3. Pour over the cabbage and toss well. Serve immediately for a crisp salad, or refrigerate overnight for a marinated flavor and texture

**Note:** A combination of red and green cabbage adds color to this salad.
