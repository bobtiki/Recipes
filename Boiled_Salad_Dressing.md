*The Kaufmanns did not eat commercial bottled dressings, so theirs were always made from scratch.*

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard
- 2 egg yolks
- 1 1/2 cups whole milk
- 1/3 cup vinegar (either white or cider vinegar)
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature

## Directions

Mix the flour, sugar, salt, and dry mustard in a saucepan. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks with the milk and vinegar. Stir the mixture slowly into the flour, whisking as you pour. Cook on the range over medium heat until the mixture is thick. Remove from the heat. Add the butter and stir. Cool to room temperature for serving. Cover and refrigerate the unused dressing.

**Note:** Leftover dressing can be kept for approximately two weeks in the refrigerator.
